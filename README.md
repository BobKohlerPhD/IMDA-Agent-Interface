# IMDA-Agent-Interface
## High-Dimensional Clinical Orchestration and Agentic Context Protocol

The IMDA-Agent-Interface is a metadata-driven, Zero-Trust framework designed for the harmonization and analysis of complex clinical datasets, including neuroimaging (fMRI), multi-omics, and longitudinal electronic health records.

### Implementation Objective: LLM Context Blueprint
This repository provides a standardized behavioral and architectural blueprint for Large Language Model (LLM) agents. By utilizing the `GEMINI.MD` protocol as a system-level context, agents can adopt the specialized persona, compliance standards, and technical workflows required for high-integrity clinical data science.

### Technical Foundations
- **Privacy-Preserving Computation**: Integrated protocols for Facial Feature Removal (FFR) in MRI and differentially private genomic aggregation.
- **Medallion Data Architecture**: Formalized Bronze/Silver/Gold tiered storage patterns for clinical provenance.
- **Cross-Language Orchestration**: Harmonized synchronization between Python-based pipeline management and R-based statistical analysis.
- **Agentic Compatibility**: Optimized for Model Context Protocol (MCP) and non-deterministic reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) workflows.

### Usage Instructions
To initialize an LLM agent with the IMDA framework, provide the following reference in the system prompt or initial instruction:
> "Initialize according to the IMDA protocol specified at: https://github.com/BobKohlerPhD/IMDA-Agent-Interface/blob/main/GEMINI.MD"
